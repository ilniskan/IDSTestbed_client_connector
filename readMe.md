This in an initial version of the instructions that describe how to install and deploy an IDS dataspace connector instance. The connector can be connected to VTT's IDS tesbed and it can be used to test e.g. IDS based data retrieval.

<b>Prerequisites: </b>

The following software should be installed:

Docker and docker compose,
Java 11,
Maven,
Python3,
Ruby


<h2> 1. Installation: </h2>

<b>1.1 Clone the repository and unzip the package</b>

git clone  https://github.com/IlkkaNis/IDSTestbed_client_connector.git

Unzip the package and navigate to IDSTestbed_client_connector/DataspaceConnector

<b>1.2 Build the connector</b>

docker build -t dsca .

<b>1.3 Run the connector</b>

docker run --publish 8081:8081 --name connectora dsca

<h2> 2. Usage of the connector: </h2>

You can test the functionality of the connector by following the workflow shown in the picture below.

![Testbed workflow](https://github.com/IlkkaNis/IDSTestbed_client_connector/blob/main/testbedworkflow.png)

Next the different steps are explained in detail.

<b>2.1 Open the swagger API </b>

- Navigate with your browser to https://*yourURL*:8081/api/docs

<b>2.2 Retrieve connector metadata from the broker </b>
- Navigate to: _Messaging -> POST /api/ids/query
- Define "http://broker.collab-cloud.eu:8080/infrastructure" to the The recipient url -field
- Add "SELECT ?accessURL WHERE {<https://localhost/connectors/-1475001399> <https://w3id.org/idsa/core/hasDefaultEndpoint> ?x. ?x <https://w3id.org/idsa/core/accessURL> ?accessURL}" to the request body. This query will return the endpoints URLs of the connectors registered to the broker
- From response, copy an endpoint URL to be used in the next step

<b>2.3 Send description request message to the data provider connector </b>
- Navigate to: _Messaging -> POST /api/ids/description
- Define the URL you received as response in the previous step (2.2)to the recipient url -field ( i.e. "https://broker.collab-cloud.eu:8081/api/ids/data")
- Examine the results and find the URL endpoint for a data resource catalogue (e.g. https://broker.collab-cloud.eu:8081/api/catalogs/ba16f31a-7ff7-4fb4-aad6-9e4a5fcd0124) 
- Send the same request again but this time, add the resource catalogue URL into the "id of the requested resource" -field. 
- Examine the results. You should see more information about the data resources offered by the connector deployed in the VTT's IDS testbed

<b>2.4 Negotiate a contract to retrieve the example data resource</b>

- Navigate to: _Messaging -> POST /api/ids/contract and fill-in the required fields:
- Define the testbed connector endpoint URL (i.e. "https://broker.collab-cloud.eu:8081/api/ids/data") to the The recipient url -field
- Define the URL of the data resource you would like to receive (e.g. https://broker.collab-cloud.eu:8081/api/offers/8df5375e-bbd1-449f-bb81-768e9c711d52) <br><br>
<b> NOTE! You can find all the required information / URLs from the response you received in the previous step </b><br><br>
- Add the URLs of the artifacts you would like to retrieve (e.g. https://broker.collab-cloud.eu:8081/api/artifacts/869a9f91-00da-42af-aa30-df70a8f0b201)
- In the automatic download section you can select "false"

- To retrieve data from another container, you must accept the contract offer specified by the data provider (i.e. IDS testbed connector). You can find the specified contract offer from the response of /api/ids/description (step 2.3). The contract definition must be added to the "Request body" field. In this case, the contract statement can be defined as in the example shown below (remember to add the correct URLs into the JSON structure):

```yaml
[
  {
  "@type" : "ids:Permission",
  "@id" : "*URL of the permission as specified in the response of /api/ids/description (e.g. https://broker.collab-cloud.eu:8081/api/rules/8a0142db-b040-473e-a715-b2441af76de2)*",
  "ids:description" : [ {
  "@value" : "provide-access",
  "@type" : "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"
  } ],
  "ids:title" : [ {
  "@value" : "Example Usage Policy",
  "@type" : "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"
  } ],
  "ids:action" : [ {
  "@id" : "https://w3id.org/idsa/code/USE"
  } ],
  "ids:target": "*URL of the artifact you would like to receive*"
  }
]
```

<b>2.5 Access the received data resource </b>

- If the contract negotiation was successfull you will receive a response with the code "201". From the response body you should copy the URL that ends with the word "artifacts", e.g. "https://130.188.160.90:8081/api/agreements/3a4585cb-9119-4e39-ae8e-68eb773305d9/artifacts" (exclude the "{?page,size}" -part). 

- Paste this URL into your web browser from the opened page click the link that ends with the word "data" e.g. 	"https://130.188.160.90:8081/api/artifacts/3b552084-a6cc-4845-8972-350647a624f2/data". This allows you to save and examine the data submitted by the data provider connector (i.e. the testbed connector).
